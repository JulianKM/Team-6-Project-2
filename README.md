# Team-6-Project-2

## Description
Basketball enthusiasts in WA can collectively plan games in different part of town along with different demands. From asking for enough people for two games or simply a 1-1 match. Local games can be found in the posted games sections and some can even require for you to donate some money for a “charity game.” Some games may require you to bring extra equipment or simply hydration like water for others. This app will serve as a community posting platform to facilitate the passion for the game.
